# Polyglot Programming

A collection of simple programs implemented in various programming languages. This repository demonstrates how the same functionality can be expressed across different programming paradigms and syntaxes.

## The Programs

Each language folder contains implementations of three basic programs:

1. **Hello World**: The classic first program that outputs "Hello World!"
2. **Counting to 10**: A program that counts from 1 to 10
3. **Input and Output**: A program that takes user input and displays it back to the user
